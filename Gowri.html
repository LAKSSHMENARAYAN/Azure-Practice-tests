        explanation: "Dynamic data masking (DDM) limits sensitive data exposure by masking it to non-privileged users. It can be used to greatly simplify the design and coding of security in your application. Dynamic data masking helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data by enabling customers to specify how much sensitive data to reveal with minimal impact on the application layer."

        explanation: "Data security is a shared responsibility between you, the customer, and your database provider. Depending on the database provider you choose, the amount of responsibility you carry can vary. If you choose an on-premises solution, you need to provide everything from end-point protection to physical security of your hardware. If you choose a PaaS cloud database provider such as Azure Cosmos DB, your area of concern shrinks considerably."

        explanation: "Clustered indexes sort and store the data rows in the table or view based on their key values. These are the columns included in the index definition. There can be only one clustered index per table, because the data rows themselves can be stored in only one order. This is also called a PRIMARY KEY."

        ],
        correctOption: "An non-relational data store does not enforce a consistent data state within the database.",
        explanation: "If your database has a lot of links that require data to exist in one place in order for data in another place to have meaning, you might need to do more work to ensure that consistency in a non-relational database. Relational databases support foreign keys, and can block certain INSERTS, UPDATES, or DELETES if the foreign key relationship doesn't allow it."

        correctOption: "Manual sharding",
        explanation: "One of the most obvious challenges when maintaining a relational database system is that most relational engines apply locks and latches to enforce strict ACID semantics. Due to these fundamental architectural restrictions, high transactional volumes can result in the need to manually shard data. Implementing manual sharding can be a time-consuming and painful exercise."
