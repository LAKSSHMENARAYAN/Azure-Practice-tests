            ],
            correctOption: "SQL Injection Attack",
            explanation: "SQL injection is an attack in which malicious code is inserted into strings that are later passed to an instance of SQL Server for parsing and execution. Any procedure that constructs SQL statements should be reviewed for injection vulnerabilities because SQL Server will execute all syntactically valid queries that it receives."

SQLDB has a server-level firewall that allows IP addresses in the range 123.123.123.0-123.123.123.255 and denies all other traffic. DB1 has a database level firewall rule that allows IPs in the range 123.123.123.0-123.123.123.10. When a client using the IP address 123.123.123.25 attempts to access DB1, are they successful?",

            ],
            correctOption: "Yes, the connection will succeed",
            explanation: "You can have both server- and database-level firewall IP rules, and they exist independently. An IP can exist in a database rule and not a server rule, and the user would have access to the specific database and not all databases on the server."

            correctOption: "A dashboard tells a story of what is going on, and contains the most important elements of that story in one page",
            explanation: "A dashboard should give you a lot of information in a limited amount of screen real estate, thus is has to summarize what is important and require you to go into another report to find the details if you wish to pursue them."
